- 👋 Hi, I’m Sahil, but my close friends call me Ibrahim
- 👀 I’m interested in simulation-based code where I can particularly bring life to my code through animation. This is primarily for applications in Fluid Dynamics.
- 🌱 I’m learning to solve Partial Differential Equations using Neural Networks. This is part of my Dissertation project in my Integrated Applied Mathematics Masters.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects on fluid dynamics and generally applied mathematics, which includes from time to time statistical models.
- 📫 How to reach me: Email: pmyss22@nottingham.ac.uk

- ⚡ Fun fact: I love freestyle/Greco-Roman wrestling, and it has taught me some of the most valuable skills. Through it, I learned that my tenacious nature could be applied to my degree and goals. I only discovered why I love mathematics when doing A-Levels and was lost, but my spirit has once again been lifted due to my love and passion for the field of fluid dynamics
